### Data Analytics Challenge (using Python Data Science Toolchain)

#### Setup
1. Download `data.zip` from the root directory of this repository.
2. Unzip `data.zip` on local machine.
3. Launch a JupyterLab session from https://jupyter.org/try
    - Click `Try Jupyter`
4. In the JupyterLab session upload the following data files:
    - `la-haute-borne-data-2018.csv`
    - `la-haute-borne-static-information.csv`
    - `data-description.csv`
<br />
<i>Refer to repository `readme` for additional information on data sets </i>

#### Challenge
<i>Complete challenge using Python Jupyter Notebook(s)</i>

The Fleet Operations team believe there are performance issues at the La Haute Borne site. They would like some deeper insights into how the turbines operated in January 2018. You will be reviewing your report (via Jupyter Notebook) with the team. The following is a list analyses and reports to the team would like to view.

1. To get an idea about the quality of the data, Fleet Operations would like the report to include the number of records in the data set.

2. By understanding what wind speeds the turbines encountered provides the team with some information on how the turbines could have performed. To this end, provide a table showing the max `Ws_avg` grouped by turbine. Please ensure to also include the `Wind_turbine_long_name` in addition to `Wind_turbine_name` in the table.

3. Circling back on data quality, report on percent of records collected in the month of January 2018 by turbine. Keep in mind that we expect to collect 6 records every 10 minutes across the month.
